Welcome, you have reached my personal website.

My name is Pragun Goyal. I am interested in ecological conservation & restoration, building all kinds of things (aka engineering), music and writing.

If you're a potential employer, please disregard the jestful style of my writing. I am by all means a very serious, hardworking and passionate engineer with a strong passion for finding simple, elegant solutions to complex problems.

If you're just reading all this for fun, I hope you enjoy reading about my journey.
