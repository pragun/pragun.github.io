This spring, I spent some time rebuilding an outdoor hydroponic grow system. In the past, I have experimented with Kratky method and Nutrient film technique (NFT).
I used small containers for the Kratky method, and was not able to grow plants effectively. My NFT system was inspired from a YouTube video, where the author
mounted a PVC pipe vertically on a 5 gallon bucket. The grow pots go in angled from the sides of the PVC pipe.
It worked pretty well.

As I'm growing older I am noticing a greater desire for making things with as little effort as possible, and things that are easy to maintain, and hopefully, sustainable.
Which meant, when I asked myself, do I want to be    
- thermoforming a PVC downspout with a heat gun  
- while trying to make a nice angled cup for the grow pots  
- while trying to make the angle of each cup, similar enough to the other cups, for the sake of aesthetics  
- while trying to enjoy the process?  
I said no. And I decided to try a different approach.

The PVC downspout  is mounted horizontally, and the holes for the grow pots are drilled using a hole saw. It takes me 5 minutes to prepare a 12Ft long downspout.
Plus I don't have to inhale PVC fumes. I hope my lungs find time to thank me between breaths.

I also did not want to have to deal with-- 
wiring any sensors,  
nor write any firmware,  
nor, multiple pumps,  
nor multiple timers,  
no wifi,  
no bluetooth,  
nor the Internet. 

I did allow myself a simple 24-hour timer that I bought from Amazon for 10$. It has a bunch of buttons,
and a rather complex workflow to program. I detest it. But over the years, I have learned how to work it. Now I would not want to change it.
