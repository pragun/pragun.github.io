I forgot to turn off the hose.
Normally, this should not have been a problem.
But the hose coupling decided, it was a good
time to kick the bucket.

So the hose ran the whole night, full pressure.

It didn't feel good. 
I was going to build a rain barrel anyways. 
But now I have to build one sooner.
As a part of my amends.

## Design Process

So far, I figure I need to decide the size of the barrel. 
I would love to get a barrel as large as humanly possible,
but I settled on a 55-gallon barrel I bought for 18$ from
someone on Facebook Marketplace.

Now, I need to find some cinder blocks,
measure the dimensions of the downspout, and
order fittings & filters needed to connect the barrel.
