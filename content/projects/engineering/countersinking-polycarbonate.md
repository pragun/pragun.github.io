Today we're countersinking polycarbonate. I tried this drill bit (on the left) with multiple flutes first. It was ok, not really satisfying.
Remembered, that I have this other countersinking bit with a wierd circular cutout for the cutting edge & chip removal. It works amazing!
Maybe sometimes it is worthwhile moving things around to explore, I would have never found this out if I kept using 
my other drill bit.
