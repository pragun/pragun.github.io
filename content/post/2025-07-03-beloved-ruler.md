And so he left, the beloved prince, the one who did do his best to see everything through kindness and love.   
The only one who did get to rule over us, and he did so justly.
He let everyone share the fruits of the Earth and Sky.  
He held a vision of love for everyone.  

A grand vision he shared with us each,
a little fragment for each,
to come together into a mind-boggling tapestry of beauty and harmony.  


Alas, he has passed away.    
But before he did, he let me in on a little secret. A little secret I shall unveil to you  now.

He said. Until love comes back to rule your bunch, let no person ever sit on the throne of your kind. Try as best as possible to be governed by a benevolent spirit. 

I asked him, I know not of many benevolent spirits. I neither know of how to tell a benevolent spirit from a malevolent spirit. I will need surely help. 

He said, get to know spirits such as Equality, Freedom and Harmony. It will take eons to know them, and when you shall have known them. Youâ€™ll reach their mother, love, the ultimate ruler there is.

If there is such a thing.

I said, but what about the grand vision you had for us?
The vision you shared, a fragment each for each one of to hold.

He smiled reassuringly, and said, "keep holding on to it",
and he left his human form behind.
